# Apache Test

> The Apache HTTP Server Project is an effort to develop and maintain an open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and Windows NT. The goal of this project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that provides HTTP services in sync with the current HTTP standards.

Based on the [Bitnami Apache](https://github.com/bitnami/bitnami-docker-apache) image for docker, this Chart bootstraps a [Apache HTTPD](https://httpd.apache.org) deployment on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster using [Helm Classic](https://helm.sh).
