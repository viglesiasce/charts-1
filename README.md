## Before you begin

### Setup a Kubernetes Cluster

The quickest way to setup a Kubernetes cluster is with [Google Container Engine](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/) (GKE) using [these instructions](https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/docs/before-you-begin).

Finish up by creating a cluster:

```bash
$ gcloud container clusters create my-cluster
```

The above command creates a new cluster named `my-cluster`. You can name the cluster according to your preferences.

> For setting up Kubernetes on other cloud platforms or bare-metal servers refer to the Kubernetes [getting started guide](http://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/).

### Install Helm

Dubbed as the Kubernetes Package Manager, Helm Classic bootstraps your Kubernetes cluster with Charts that provide ready-to-use workloads.

To install Helm Classic, refer to the [Helm Classic install guide](https://github.com/helm/helm-classic#installing-helm-classic) and ensure that the `helmc` binary is in the `PATH` of your shell.

### Bitnami Charts Repo
